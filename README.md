# EPSRC Sensor CDT report template

This repository provides a LaTeX document class and LyX layout file for producing reports in the style required by the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Sensor Technologies and Applications.
To make full use of the template, you will need to install the DejaVu Sans Mono, Minion Pro, Myriad Pro and XITS Maths fonts and typeset using ``xelatex`` or ``lualatex``.
A signature can be included on the declaration page by including a ``signature.png`` file in the same directory as the LaTeX source (or LyX) file.
